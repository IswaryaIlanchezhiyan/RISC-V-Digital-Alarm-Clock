# RISC-V-Digital-Alarm-Clock

# RISC-V GNU Tool Chain

  RISC-V GNU Tool Chain is a  C and C++ cross-compiler. It supports two build modes: a generic ELF/Newlib toolchain and a more sophisticated Linux-ELF/glibc toolchain.


# Digital Alarm Clock

Alarm Clocks are very useful devices in todayâ€™s busy life. They are designed to make a signal / alarm at a specific time. The use of digital alarm clocks has increased over years with development in electronics.

The advantage of digital alarm clocks over analogue alarm clocks is that they require less power, the time can be set or reset easily and displays the time in digits. Design of a simple digital alarm clock is explained here.

Digital clocks are also known as LED clocks or liquid crystal displays (LCDs).

# C Code

```


```

# Assembly Code

```
gcc sample.c
./a.out
riscv32-unknown-elf-gcc -c -mabi=ilp32 -march=rv32im -ffreestanding -o ./sample sample.c
riscv32-unknown-elf-objdump -d sample

```

```


```

# Unique Instructions

Create a sample_assembly.txt file and dump the assembly code into this file.Now,run the instruction_counter.py file.

```

cd home/Documents/ASIC$ python3 instruction_counter.py

```

```
